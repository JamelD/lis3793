### Assignment 2: Persona

#### Objectives 
Prior to this assignment, you will work in teams to identify the main users of the site you are re-designing. Based on this analysis, you will create a persona to represent one main user group for your client’s site. Each member of the team must choose one unique character to work on so that you can represent different user types.

Also, before you start working on this assignment, please review Week 4 readings and w5s1_understanding_people_pt2 (Understanding People, Part 2:Scenarios, Personas) slideset.

#### Tasks
Format and Layout: There are a variety of ways you can format this deliverable – be creative and organized in presenting information. Think about this document as something you would present to your client. Try to fit everything on one page but make sure the font is readable (10-12 pt). 

Pointers for Creating Your Persona: 
- Describe in detail the persona’s characteristics that might influence his/her use of the website you are designing. 
- When appropriate you may visualize key information (i.e., skill and knowledge levels) using graphical elements such as tables, graphs, etc. – again, the aim is to make it easy for your clients to visualize key characteristics of your persona that would affect their interaction with the site. 
- You may use the first or third person to refer to your persona. 


#### General Requirements
Information to Include: Personas can be described different ways. The following is a list of information that you MUST include in your assignment. You may include additional information if space allows.
1.	Name (to represent this hypothetical character)
2.	Age
3.	Photo (choose a picture that best depicts your persona)
4.	Relevant occupational or status information that might impact site use. For example…
    - If you are designing a school site and your persona is a student, you would need to information such as major and minor, student status, university, place of work and position, etc.
    - If you are designing a bank site and your persona represents general clients, you would need information such as marital status, job and position, salary level, etc.
5.	User goals: 
    - What tasks would the persona want to accomplish on the site (list at least 5; use complete sentences starting with a verb to describe each task). For example, a parent user of a Middle School website would have a task to register her child in After School Program.
    - What specific information would the persona be interested in finding on the site (list at least 5; you can use a question to indicate this). For example, referring to the above task example, the parent would be interested in finding the following information: “How much does After School Program cost?” “What are the After School Program’s activities?” “What are the After School Program’s hours of operation?
6.	Technical skills level. Describe the persona’s computer and technical proficiency and types of technology and tools they might use frequently. 
7.	Subject matter expertise or familiarity with topic of website.  Describe the persona’s knowledge level as this relates to the main content area of the site. Would they have difficulty understanding content? How much assistance understanding the content would they need?
8.	Frequency of use. Describe how frequent the persona might use the site.
9.	Motivation or Triggers:
    - Describe what would motivate the persona to use the site (not just tasks, but end results). For example, in our earlier scenario of a Usability.gov user: “Wants to create usable sites compliant with the latest usability standards.”). 
    - Describe how the persona might come to know of the site.
10.	Brief Scenario – write a brief narrative illustrating a typical situation in which the persona might use the site and complete his/her main tasks on the site.
