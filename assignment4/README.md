### Assignment 4: Prototype

#### Objectives 
A wireframe-based prototype is simply a mockup of your proposed site. Wireframe based prototypes help you visualize and test your ideas for design without having to do any programming. Prototyping plays a significant role in user-centered design and can be used to catch design flaws and modify ideas early on. 

For this class, you will create a wireframe-based prototype: a set of annotated high-fidelity wireframes (see actual example below) for your client’s homepage and at least 3 pages representing key user tasks identified in your task/user analysis (see Assignment #3). If you did not have at least 3 pages, in addition to the homepage, identified in Assignment #3, then you must modify the task or choose a different task to model to meet this assignment’s requirements. 

#### Tasks
Each wireframe should: 
1. Illustrate where key page elements will be located on the page (e.g., header, footer, navigation, content objects, branding elements); 
2. Indicate where content text and images (and other content) will be located on the page using appropriate placeholders to represent each (e.g., Lorem Ipsum to represent paragraph text; image boxes, video boxes, galleries, etc. to represent things like images, video; and other types of placeholders). NOTE: when representing text that require specific formatting [e.g., phone numbers (XXX) XXX-XXXX; other contact information], illustrate the prescribed formatting;
3. clearly demarcate how elements might be grouped (e.g., such as side bars, navigation bars, content areas); and
4. include proper labeling for main elements (e.g., page title, navigation links, headings to content objects, etc.). 

The final prototype site design should consider the intended client’s needs, the main purpose of the site, and the needs of the intended users. Moreover, the site will be judged on the following criteria: information organization, information representation, navigation, interface design, and usability.

#### General Requirements
Create Your Wireframe Based Prototypes 
1. Use a professional graphics software or prototyping tool that will allow you to create professional looking prototypes for presentation to your client.
2. Create prototypes for the following
    - A High-fidelity home or landing page
    - At least 3 low-fidelity pages a user will see as they complete key task(s) (you may use the tasks you analyzed in your User Flow Assignment or you can change this with instructor’s approval). These pages must show some level of complexity.
3. For each wireframe, include:
    - Clear navigation menus properly labeled – name all your links properly;
    - Any calls to action for specific pages;
    - Sample graphics or placeholders for images and any other content element that needs to be represented on each page. If the organization has an official logo, make sure you include this in your wireframe;
    - Dummy text properly laid out and sized in such a way that will approximate the amount of space actual text will occupy on the page;
    Important Note: You are required to create actual content for the homepage – see 4b below.
    - Header and footer information properly labeled; and
    - Breadcrumb navigation where appropriate. 
4. For your homepage, include:
    - All major elements described in #3.
    - Main difference is, you must have actual content for this page. This content need not be very long but should highlight your main calls to action.
5. You may use the actual fonts, colors, and global graphics (e.g., logo, etc.) you intend to use for the proposed site.
6. Add annotations to each wireframe. Cleary number your annotations and label what elements these refer to. Annotations are brief notes explaining main elements of your wireframe design and the main tasks they support (annotations may be in form of callouts or numbered annotations). Specifically, annotations may include:
    - Functional annotations: notes that briefly explains what happens when user does something (e.g., clicks a button or link; responses to mouseovers, etc.)
    - Content annotations: the gist of the content or what type of text will appear in the area.

Checklist for Packaging your Wireframe based Prototypes (IA Portfolio)
1. Present all your mock-up pages in one professional package/portfolio (that you hypothetically would provide to your client). 
    - Use a professional prototyping tool to create your annotated wireframes (e.g., Balsamiq, Photoshop, Visio, Omnigraffle, Axure, Keynotopia, etc.).
    - Export your annotated wireframes as high-resolution images (e.g., PNG or JPEG). NOTE: Images must be clear, sharp, and not blurry. 
    - Insert the wireframe images into a Word document to create your portfolio. 
    - Show one wireframe per page –change the orientation of wireframed pages to landscape to show all mockups clearly. 
    - Remember to include both content and functional annotations to key elements – note important improvements in IA in your annotations.
    - Insert page numbers. 
    - Label each page clearly and use subheadings where appropriate.
2. What should each portfolio include?
    - A cover page with the following information:
    - Your name:
    - Name of organization:
    - URL of existing site:
    - One page summarizing the following information:
    - Main goals of the client for the site
    - Primary target users for the site (briefly describe the main information needs and tasks for each user group)
    - List of the main changes/improvements you made to the IA design of the site (for each item, briefly describe what you did and why you did it)
    - One page containing the high-fidelity wireframe for the redesigned home page with annotations. 
    - Three other low-fidelity wireframes depicting webpages/screens your persona will see as they complete key user task(s). Make sure to specify what that key user task(s) is. Again, for each wireframe, add brief and numbered annotations (see p. 2 for details)

Main Points to Consider in your IA Design
1. Home page: 
    - Does the home page have a clear call to action?
    - Is there good information scent? Can you immediately tell the main purpose of the site on the homepage?
    - Does it have a few human-interest elements to appeal to users?
    - Are all major/global navigation items clearly/appropriately labeled?
    - Can every element on the homepage be justified?
2. Functionality
    - Do the redesigned web pages support all the functions and capabilities one would expect for this type of website?
3. Navigation
    - Do the redesigned web pages support good wayfinding?
    - Do the redesigned web pages use different strategies to promote good navigation:
    - Breadcrumb navigation (when appropriate)
    - Repeating subheadings in content areas
    - Anchor tags
4. Information organization and representation
    - Do the redesigned web pages contain all the content items one would expect for this type of website?
    - Are content items appropriately grouped/chunked?
    - Are appropriate and descriptive subheadings used to represent each information chunk?
    - Are navigation items appropriately labeled to support intuitive wayfinding?
5. Interface design
    - Does the interface design promote good findability?
    - Is there a good balance between content items and white space?
    - Are color, dimension, and placement used appropriately to indicate prioritization of content items?
6. Overall IA design
    - How well does the overall information design support the main tasks and information needs of the primary target users of the site?
    - How well does the overall IA design address the goals of the client?

Reviewing and Submitting Your Assignment 
1. Before submitting, make sure you:
    - review the assignment carefully for grammatical and typographical errors (points will be deducted for these errors, so be thorough); and
    - review the guidelines to ensure that you had followed all the instructions (points will be deducted for not following instructions.)
