### Assignment 3: Task Flow Diagram

#### Objectives 
Create a flow chart illustrating the specific steps (or series of tasks) that users need to do to accomplish each main user task that you identified for your persona.

#### Tasks
Instructions
1. List at least three main tasks that your persona would need to complete on your site. 
2. Choose one of these main tasks and do the following:
    - Write a full-scale task scenario describing how your persona completes this main task on the current site. A full-scale scenario describes all the steps that your target user needs to do to accomplish the task – this is different from a use case because it is written from the user's point of view rather than from the system’s point of view.
    - Current Task Flow: Create a flow chart illustrating the specific steps (or series of tasks) that users need to do or go through to complete this task on the current site. Note possible frustration points (see example below).
    - Redesigned Task Flow: Recommend a solution for how your redesigned site can support this task better. Create another flow chart to illustrate the specific steps (or series of tasks) that users need to do or go through to complete this task on the redesigned site. 
    - Write a one-paragraph summary of the advantages of implementing your solution.

Guidelines for Creating Flow Charts
1. Create your diagrams using a professional flowcharting or prototyping tool of your choice. You can find examples under the Library -> IT Tools -> Prototyping Tools of the Course Blackboard. I recommend Balsamiq: http://www.balsamiq.com/. You can also use any word processing software (e.g., MS Word) to draw a diagram.
2. Use a state flow diagram format to illustrate how the user would interact with the site to complete this task on the existing site and your proposed redesign. The image below shows the general state flow format. This page also explains the state flow diagram format in a little bit more detail here: http://conversionxl.com/how-to-design-user-flow/#ixzz27aRGoDzv. (see under State Diagrams only, ignore the rest)
