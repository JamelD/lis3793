### LIS 3793 Requirements:

*Course Work Links:*

1. [Assignment 1 README.md](assignment1/README.md "My Assignment 1 README.md file")
    + Gather information about your client organization and the website project. Provide an overview of the client, the current site, the client’s business goals, reasons for the site redesign, technological capabilities/requirements, and plans for marketing and updating the website. Then prepare a report (at least 1500 words not including tables and other supporting evidence) to summarize your findings. You can do a number of things to complete this portion of the report:
        - Collect various materials about your agency (e.g., brochures, articles, etc.).
        - Include screenshots of the existing site.
        - Do a benchmark analysis of other organizations’ websites that are similar in purpose to your client’s.
        - Include screenshots of competitor/related sites.
        - Recruit your friend to evaluate the group project website by performing predefined tasks and thinking aloud. Include a report of the evaluation’s findings and recommendations for the redesign project.

2. [Assignment 2 README.md](assignment2/README.md "My Assignment 2 README.md file")
    - Prior to this assignment, you will work in teams to identify the main users of the site you are re-designing. Based on this analysis, you will create a persona to represent one main user group for your client’s site. Each member of the team must choose one unique character to work on so that you can represent different user types.
    - Also, before you start working on this assignment, please review Week 4 readings and w5s1_understanding_people_pt2 (Understanding People, Part 2:Scenarios, Personas) slideset.

3. [Assignment 3 README.md](assignment3/README.md "My Assignment 3 README.md file")
    - Create a flow chart illustrating the specific steps (or series of tasks) that users need to do to accomplish each main user task that you identified for your persona.

4. [Assignment 4 README.md](assignment4/README.md "My Assignment 4 README.md file")
    - A wireframe-based prototype is simply a mockup of your proposed site. Wireframe based prototypes help you visualize and test your ideas for design without having to do any programming. Prototyping plays a significant role in user-centered design and can be used to catch design flaws and modify ideas early on. 
    - For this class, you will create a wireframe-based prototype: a set of annotated high-fidelity wireframes (see actual example below) for your client’s homepage and at least 3 pages representing key user tasks identified in your task/user analysis (see Assignment #3). If you did not have at least 3 pages, in addition to the homepage, identified in Assignment #3, then you must modify the task or choose a different task to model to meet this assignment’s requirements. 

5. [Assignment 5 README.md](assignment5/README.md "My Assignment 5 README.md file")
    + There are two objectives for this assignment: 
        - for you to demonstrate the ability to critically analyze IA design 
        - to help one another by providing initial feedback. 

6. [Assignment 6 README.md](assignment6/README.md "My Assignment 6 README.md file")
    - Write a 800-1000 word essay describing what you learned from this course and the IA process. 

7. [Activity Assignments README.md](activity/README.md "My Activity Assignments README.md file")
    - TBA
