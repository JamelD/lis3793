### Assignment 1: Needs Analysis

#### Objectives 
Gather information about your client organization and the website project. Provide an overview of the client, the current site, the client’s business goals, reasons for the site redesign, technological capabilities/requirements, and plans for marketing and updating the website. Then prepare a report (at least 1500 words not including tables and other supporting evidence) to summarize your findings. You can do a number of things to complete this portion of the report:
- Collect various materials about your agency (e.g., brochures, articles, etc.).
- Include screenshots of the existing site.
- Do a benchmark analysis of other organizations’ websites that are similar in purpose to your client’s.
- Include screenshots of competitor/related sites.
- Recruit your friend to evaluate the group project website by performing predefined tasks and thinking aloud. Include a report of the evaluation’s findings and recommendations for the redesign project.

#### Tasks
Here are some guide questions to help you organize your data gathering. However, remember these are only guideline questions. Address as many of these questions as you can but also feel free to add any other information that may help your reader have a better understanding about your client and their website. As you will use this information to support your design decisions, take care to gather and present detailed and accurate data based on solid research. Document the methods you used to gather this information including the names of people you were able to contact.

1. General Information 
    - What is the name of the company and the current (or intended) URL? 
    - Bonus points if you are able to get the following information:
        + Who are the primary contacts from the organization, and who has final approval on the project? Please list names, titles, email addresses, and phone numbers. 
2. Goals for the Website
    - What are your client’s primary online business objectives for the site (e.g., increased sales, marketing/branding, awareness, fewer customer service calls, etc.)? 
    - What are their secondary objectives? 
    - Bonus points if you are able to get the following information:
        + According to your clients, what adjective would they want potential visitors to describe the site with (e.g., prestigious, friendly, corporate, fun, forward thinking, innovative, cutting edge, etc.)? Is this different from the current image perception?
        + How does the company differentiate itself from its competitors or similar organizations?
        + What are your client’s main reasons for wanting to redesign the site (e.g., new business model, outdated site, expanded services, different audience?)?
        + What existing strategy (both online and offline is in place to meet the new business objectives? (E.g., if they intend to include an online donation tool, how do they plan to maintain this?)
3. Current Site
    - Describe briefly the current site. Provide a screenshot of the current site for reference (include a label and caption for each screenshot).
    - How often is the site updated? (If you can’t find out from talking to the client, try doing a search for versions of the site using the Wayback Machine: http://archive.org/web/web.php) 
    Bonus Question
    - Who will be in charge of maintaining the site? Who will be in charge of technical issues? Who will be providing and managing content updates?
4. Heuristic Evaluation
    - Conduct a heuristic evaluation of the site with 2-3 experts (you may use your teammates as your “expert” consultants). Attach a copy of the heuristic evaluation in an appendix to this report. A sample heuristic evaluation will be provided in one of the in-class activities. Analyze and summarize results of the heuristic evaluations by answering the following questions:
        + What specific aspects of the site work well? What specific areas are well-designed?
        + What are the main shortcomings of the site? What aspects need to be improved?
5. Benchmark Analysis of Competitive or Related Sites
    - Search online for at least 2 sites maintained by competitors or other organizations similar to your client organization. Take screenshots of each website and include in your report (always label images and provide captions for each).
    - For each website:
        + Describe the best features/aspects of the site.
        + Describe aspects of the site that needs improvement.
        + Briefly note which elements (e.g., sections, navigation systems and/or labeling systems) you would like your prototype site to emulate/adopt.
6. User test your client's website using your friend as a participant
    - Test your client's website using friend(s) as a participant. Design a set of two user tasks for the website and ask your friend spend 10-15 minutes attempting to accomplish your tasks. Have her/him think aloud like describing what s/he is thinking and experiencing as s/he goes along. You should act as the silent analyst and take notes. Report here the following: 
        + Description of the experiment (i.e., the website analyzed, the user tasks used)
        + Summary of test results
        + Interpretations of the results and recommendations for the redesign.
7. Content
    - What is the basic structure of the content of the current site, and how is it organized? 
    - Describe the visual elements or content that should be utilized from the current site or marketing materials (logo, color scheme, navigation, naming conventions, etc.)
8. Intended Primary Users of the Site
    - Who are the intended primary users of the site? Give basic demographics: gender, age, race, income level, education, occupation, technological capabilities, etc.
    - What 3-5 primary tasks will the intended primary users of the site do when they come to the site (e.g., make a purchase, become a member, search for information, etc.)? Provide as much detail here as possible.
    - What special considerations should you keep in mind when designing the site for your primary audience (e.g., older populations, kids, donors, customers, etc.)?
7. Analysis and Design Recommendations
    - Analyze the data you gathered and identify what are the main issues with the current site that need to be addressed.
    - List briefly your main design recommendations based on your analysis. (Note that these may change as you continue working on the project. This is critical at this stage though as this can be used for writing proposals for your client and estimating the scope of work and resources needed for the project.)
8. Research Methods
    - List all the research methods you used to gather information for this assignment.
9. Sources
    - List all the sources and materials used for this report.
