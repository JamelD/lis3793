#### General Requirements
Important Notes:
- Answer all the questions. This is a reflective exercise so I want to know what YOU think. At the same time, your ideas should be based on a solid understanding of the course content. As such, you are also expected to provide specific and detailed support for your ideas by citing credible and accurate sources. But don't use a lot of direct quotes - I am interested in our interpretation. Your essays will be uploaded onto Turnitin to check for plagiarism, so make sure you use your own words, use minimal direct quotations, and cite your sources properly using APA 6th format (do not use footnotes). Sources will not be included in the word count.
- Write an insightful and coherent narrative with sufficiently developed and supported points. Organize your ideas logically, provide good transitions between sentences and paragraphs, and make sure you are able to connect your ideas meaningfully.
- Use single line spacing within paragraphs with an additional space between paragraphs.
- Set margins to 1‚Äù on all sides.
- Choose a readable 11-12 pt font for your text. Use a consistent style to distinguish between your body text and different heading levels.
- As mentioned earlier, support your ideas with credible evidence and resources. Use the APA "author-date" system to cite your sources within your narrative. Also provide a list of references at the end of your document. Use APA 6thcitation format:
    + Guidelines for formatting a list of references can be found here: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/1/ (from here you can find specific formatting requirements for different types of sources.
    + Guidelines for citing sources within your narrative can be found here: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/03/
